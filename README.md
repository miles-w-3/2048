## Current progress
* Initialized Tile and board classes
* Tiles are currently buttons with 
* Created function to randomly add tile, will be used at program start and throughout the program after each move

## Next goals
* Add in arrow key movement detection
  * Then add logic for combining tiles - implement one case then abstract (could start with just moving all tiles in one direction, start with the opposite direction and move over square by square) 
* Transition tile buttons into fully-functioning objects with set size, text content, and color
* Eventually, add score
* Add 2048 win detection
