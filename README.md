## Current progress
* Initialized Tile and board classes
* Tiles are currently just html buttons for simplicity
* KeyListener and starting tiles are now initialized
* Moving with up arrows now does simple shift up, need to manage merges and add functionality with other arrow keys

## Goals
* Transition tile buttons into fully-functioning objects with set size, text content, and color
    * Hopefully can get them to animate as the
* Add 2048 win detection
* Also add loss detection, maybe when you try to fill a new tile and no open tile can be found
* Eventually, add score
* If the scope of this project expands, potentially add a database of user scores, 
users can log in (maybe with just a username) and raise their score
    * Users would create an account if they want their score saved in the first place



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
